 * The `center` point is known to be within the feature. For very large features the center
 * point may be much further than the closest point in the feature. To make this calculation
 * more accurate we use the spatial information in the cover's x, y, z coord. Since
 * the feature is partially located somewhere in the cover's tile, the distance to the feature
 * must be smaller than the distance to the furthest corner in the tile.
